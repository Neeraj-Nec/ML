# Definition of Statistic

A **statistic** is a number that tells us something about a group of data. It helps us understand, compare, or analyze information.

For example:  
- The **average** score in a test  
- The **percentage** of people who like a movie  

Statistics make data easier to understand! 📊😊

# Definition of Data 

A **Data** is facts or piece of information .

# 📊 Types of Statistics

## 1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics help summarize and describe the features of a dataset.

### Example:
A teacher records the scores of 5 students in a math test:
📌 **Scores**: 85, 90, 78, 92, 88

Using descriptive statistics, we can summarize this data:

- **Mean (Average)**: (85 + 90 + 78 + 92 + 88) / 5 = 86.6
- **Median (Middle Value)**: 88
- **Mode (Most Frequent Value)**: None (since all values appear once)
- **Standard Deviation**: Measures how spread out the scores are.

## 2️⃣ Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics use sample data to make predictions or draw conclusions about a larger population.

### Example:
Imagine a company surveys 100 customers about a new product.
📌 **Results**: 70% of the sample liked the product.

Using inferential statistics, we can estimate that approximately 70% of the company's entire customer base might like the product.

**In simple term like if you have data and you will perform some mathmetic to define the data like mean , median the this is Descriptive Statistics on the other hand if you will perform some test to reach at some conclusion then it is kind of Inferential Statistics**

# Note 

## Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. Common methods include calculating measures like mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation. It provides a clear overview of the data without making any conclusions beyond the data itself.

## Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics involves making inferences or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data. It uses statistical tests to reach conclusions, such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Inferential statistics allows us to make predictions or draw conclusions about a larger group based on the sample data.
