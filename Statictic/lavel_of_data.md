# Levels of Data

Data can be classified into four main levels, each with different characteristics and types of analysis that can be performed on them. These levels are:

## 1. Nominal Level
- **Definition**: Nominal data represents categories without any specific order or ranking. The categories are mutually exclusive.
- **Example**: Types of fruits (e.g., apple, banana, orange) or colors (e.g., red, blue, green).

## 2. Ordinal Level
- **Definition**: Ordinal data represents categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between the ranks are not necessarily equal.
- **Example**: Customer satisfaction ratings (e.g., poor, fair, good, excellent) or education levels (e.g., high school, bachelor's, master's).

## 3. Interval Level
- **Definition**: Interval data represents numerical values where the intervals between values are meaningful, but there is no true zero point.
- **Example**: Temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit (e.g., 20°C, 30°C) where the difference between temperatures is meaningful but there is no absolute zero.

## 4. Ratio Level
- **Definition**: Ratio data represents numerical values with a meaningful zero point, allowing for the comparison of absolute magnitudes.
- **Example**: Height (e.g., 170 cm), weight (e.g., 70 kg), or income (e.g., $50,000) where zero indicates the absence of the quantity.
